# MachineLearningWithPython_Project
This project was part of my IBM Professional Certificate. It consisted about choosing the best classifier for the dataset.

Four Algorithms were used for predictions: KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression.

The accuracy of each model was determined using Jaccard, F1-score and LogLoss.
